# docs/tools/ai

This directory mirrors the previous `tools/ai` utilities but now lives under `docs/tools/ai` for repository bookkeeping.

Notes:
- Runtime AI outputs should still be written to `docs/tools/ai/generated/` and usually not committed. The repository keeps `docs/tools/ai/.gitkeep` for directory presence.
- Use `docs/tools/ai/move_and_untrack_ai_files.ps1` to relocate and untrack tracked AI artifacts if needed.
